# Mapping Earthquakes

## Overview

- The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes and locaions of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days. It will allow us to compare earthquake location to tectonic plate edges location.
- To complete this project we will use a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days.
- We will use the JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data, the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.
- The project will have three base layer maps that can be toggled. It will also have three overlay layers (earthquakes, major earthquakes, tectonic plates) created from geoJson data, that can be toggled off or on.
